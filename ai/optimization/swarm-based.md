# Swarm-Based Optimization Algorithms

This file contains **nature-inspired swarm intelligence optimization algorithms**.  
These algorithms are inspired by the collective behavior of biological systems (birds, ants, bees, etc.) and are widely used in **continuous and combinatorial optimization** problems.

## 📌 1. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

- **Year:** 1995
- **Authors:** Kennedy & Eberhart
- **Original Paper:** [Link PDF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/488968)

**Summary:**  
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based stochastic optimization algorithm inspired by **bird flocking or fish schooling**:

- Each particle represents a candidate solution.
- Particles move through the search space influenced by their own best position and the best-known position of the swarm.
- PSO is efficient for continuous, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional optimization problems.

## 📌 2. Ant Colony Optimization for Continuous Domains (ACOR)

- **Year:** 2008
- **Authors:** Socha & Dorigo
- **Original Paper:** [Link PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706006333?via%3Dihub)

**Summary:**  
ACOR extends classical Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to **continuous domains**:

- Uses artificial ants to probabilistically explore solutions.
- Maintains a **solution archive** to guide the search.

## 📌 3. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)

- **Year:** 2005
- **Authors:** Karaboğa, Derviş
- **Original Paper:** [Link PDF](https://abc.erciyes.edu.tr/pub/tr06_2005.pdf)

**Summary:**  
ABC is inspired by the **foraging behavior of honey bees**:

- Employs **employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees** to explore solutions.
