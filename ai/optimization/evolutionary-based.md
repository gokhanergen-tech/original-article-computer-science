# Evolutionary-Based Optimization Algorithms

This file contains **evolutionary algorithms (EA)**, which are inspired by **natural selection and evolution principles**.  
These algorithms use **mutation, crossover, and selection** to evolve candidate solutions for optimization problems.

**Summary:**  
Differential Evolution (DE) is a **population-based evolutionary algorithm**:

- Candidate solutions are combined using **vector differences between randomly chosen individuals**.
- Applies **mutation, crossover, and selection** to evolve the population.
- Highly effective for **continuous, nonlinear, high-dimensional optimization problems**.
